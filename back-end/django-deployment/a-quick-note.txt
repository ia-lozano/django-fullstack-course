For Django deployment, we're going to be using a free account pythonanywhere.com and github.com

Once registered in pythonanywhere.com, we'll open the bash console and write the following commands:

Check Python version
$ python --version

Make a virtual environment, (with Python 3.10.5 and Django 4.1 in this case)

$ mkvirtualenv --python=python3.10.5 [project_name]
$ pip install -U django==4.1

NOTE that you need to use the $ workon [env_name] to reactivate your virtuan environment

We can check the all the installed packages in our environment with the following command:

$ pip list

Now we create a Git repo in our Django project directory [maindir/django_project] and push it to a Github repo
with the following commands:

> git init

> git add .

> git commit -m ["message"]

> git remote add origin [HTTPS Github repo url]

> git push origin main

Now we're set.

Let's go back to pythonanywhere.com Bash console and write the following command:

$ git clone [Github repo url]

Now you have the code from your Github repo within your Django environment

cd into the django_project directory:

$ ls

$ [repo name]/[project name]

you should see the (main) or (master) branch name

Now, make migrations:

$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate

And create a supersuer

$ python manage.py createsuperuser

We're done in the Bash console for now, go to the Web tab in your pythonanywhere account and
add a new web app. Select the manual config and then go to the Virtualenv section, there,
enter the next path:

home/[your username]/.virtualenvs/[your venv name]

now in the Code section, put the actual path to your code, if you dont remember it, go to the console,
cd into your Django prject directory and write pwd command, it will return a line like this:

/home/[your username]/[Github repo name]/[Django project name]

Copy that path into the source code field.

Now, go to the WSGI.py file and delete all the code
and comment quit the comment from the next lines:

import os
import sys

path = '/home/1000gec/django-deployment-example/template_project'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)

os.chdir(path)

os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "template_project.settings")

import django
django.setup()

from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()

Make sure to add the 'yoursite.pythonanywhere.com' host to ALLOWED_HOSTS in your
settings.py file.

Once all the changes are made click on Reload yoursite.pythonanywhere.com

Now set your static files in the Static files section so your admin site looks nice:

URL: /static/admin

Directory: /home/1000gec/.virtualenvs/myproj/lib/python3.10/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/static/admin

The exact path depends on your username, project name, and python version.

You can also link your static files:

/static

/home/1000gec/django-deployment-example/template_project/static

DO NOT FORGET TO SET DEBUG = False in your settings.py file.
